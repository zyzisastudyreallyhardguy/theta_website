                        <p>Accurately predicting protein–ligand interactions is crucial for understanding cellular
                            processes. We introduce SurfDock, a deep-learning method that addresses this challenge by
                            integrating protein sequence, three-dimensional structural graphs and surface-level features
                            into an equivariant architecture. SurfDock employs a generative diffusion model on a
                            non-Euclidean manifold, optimizing molecular translations, rotations and torsions to
                            generate reliable binding poses. Our extensive evaluations across various benchmarks
                            demonstrate SurfDock’s superiority over existing methods in docking success rates and
                            adherence to physical constraints. It also exhibits remarkable generalizability to unseen
                            proteins and predicted apo structures, while achieving state-of-the-art performance in
                            virtual screening tasks. In a real-world application, SurfDock identified seven novel hit
                            molecules in a virtual screening project targeting aldehyde dehydrogenase 1B1, a key enzyme
                            in cellular metabolism. This showcases SurfDock’s ability to elucidate molecular mechanisms
                            underlying cellular processes. These results highlight SurfDock’s potential as a
                            transformative tool in structural biology, offering enhanced accuracy, physical plausibility
                            and practical applicability in understanding protein–ligand interactions.</p>

                        <h4>Abstract</h4>
                        <p>Protein design is undergoing a revolution driven by artificial intelligence (AI),
                            transforming how we engineer proteins for applications in drug discovery, biotechnology and
                            synthetic biology. By navigating the immense complexity of protein sequence space and
                            overcoming the limitations of structural and functional data, AI enables unprecedented
                            precision and speed in designing novel proteins with tailored functions. Central to this
                            Review is a comprehensive and actionable roadmap for designers, providing step-by-step
                            guidance on how to integrate state-of-the-art AI tools into protein design workflows,
                            including tools for structural and functional prediction as well as generative models for de
                            novo design. To illustrate this roadmap in practice, we present case studies showcasing
                            AI-driven protein design, from engineering therapeutic proteins to designing novel proteins
                            that unlock enzyme functions and reprogramme biomolecular systems. Looking ahead, we outline
                            future directions highlighting the vast potential of AI to revolutionize synthetic biology,
                            expedite drug development and drive sustainable biotechnology, positioning it as a
                            transformative force at the forefront of protein design.</p>

                        <h4>Abstract</h4>
                        <p>Developing robust methods for evaluating protein–ligand interactions has been a long-standing
                            problem. Data-driven methods may memorize ligand and protein training data rather than
                            learning protein–ligand interactions. Here we show a scoring approach called EquiScore,
                            which utilizes a heterogeneous graph neural network to integrate physical prior knowledge
                            and characterize protein–ligand interactions in equivariant geometric space. EquiScore is
                            trained based on a new dataset constructed with multiple data augmentation strategies and a
                            stringent redundancy-removal scheme. On two large external test sets, EquiScore consistently
                            achieved top-ranking performance compared to 21 other methods. When EquiScore is used
                            alongside different docking methods, it can effectively enhance the screening ability of
                            these docking methods. EquiScore also showed good performance on the activity-ranking task
                            of a series of structural analogues, indicating its potential to guide lead compound
                            optimization. Finally, we investigated different levels of interpretability of EquiScore,
                            which may provide more insights into structure-based drug design.</p>
